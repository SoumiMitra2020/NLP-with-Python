Named Entity Recognition

Named Entity Recognition is the process of NLP which deals with identifying and classifying named entities. The raw and structured text is taken and named entities are classified into persons, organizations, places, money, time, etc. Basically, named entities are identified and segmented into various predefined classes.

NER systems are developed with various linguistic approaches, as well as statistical and machine learning methods. NER has many applications for project or business purposes.

NER model first identifies an entity and then categorizes the entity into the most suitable class. Some of the common types of Named Entities will be:

1. Organisations :

NASA, CERN, ISRO, etc

2. Places:

Mumbai, New York, Kolkata.

3. Money:

1 Billion Dollars, 50 Great Britain Pounds.

4. Date:

15th August 2020

5. Person:

Elon Musk, Richard Feynman, Subhas Chandra Bose.

An important thing about NER models is that their ability to understand Named Entities depends on the data they have been trained on. There are many applications of NER.

NER can be used for content classification, the various Named Entities of a text can be collected, and based on that data, the content themes can be understood. In academics and research, NER can be used to retrieve data and information faster from a wide variety of textual information. NER helps a lot in the case of information extraction from huge text datasets.
